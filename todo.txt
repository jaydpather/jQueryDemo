DONE fix <hr> tag on index page.  (not clearing left)
DONEimplement views for each page.  (page title and lorem ipsum)
X implement maxwidth for content area once lorem ipsum is done
DONE add URLs for each left nav link
X add URL onclick event to change leftnav link class
DONE	working, BUT: navigating to the next page undoes the css changes made by jquery calls
DONE implement pushpin onclick: minimize leftnav bar (make sure content area slides accordingly)
DONE implement mouseover that will maximize leftnav bar (in minimized state), keep it maximized in maximized-autohide state, and minimize on mouse leave in autohide state
DONE Need to find a way to maintain min/max state when the user navigates to a new page
DONE clicking pushpin shouldn't minimize leftnav until you mouse away
DONE pushpin should be horizontal in maximised-autohide state
DONE modify pushpin onclick: turn off autohide state.  rotate back to normal
		need to figure out how to remove an event handler for this.  (need to remove mouseover events)
		need to modify Ready event to remove leftnav hover events if needed, and rotate pushpin icon if needed (refactor code for add/remove leftnav events into their own method)
DONE add animation to minimize/maximize so it doesn't "jump" so harshly
DONE modify homepage text to explain the app.  (maybe do this on all pages?)
DONE test in all browsers
